# Communicate with R

In this chapter we will look at ways in which we can communicate our analysis results effectively to other stakeholders. We will cover writing reports using R markdown. We do have a modern way of writing reports in R using quarto but I will not be able to cover that here. But once you master Rmarkdown, transitioning to Quarto is not difficult. With Rmarkdown we can generate reports as HTML pages, word documents or even pdf formats. We can make slides as well, which we will explore towards the end of the chapter.

## Introduction to Rmarkdown

Rmarkdown is a package developed to help in rendering your code together with prose or written explanations of what the code is doing. You can still write purely prose documents without any code in them.
