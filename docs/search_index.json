In this text you will learn about R, how to install it and how to use it effectively in your data science tasks. 1.1 Usage Each bookdown chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter must start with a first-level heading: # A good chapter, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading. Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: ## A short section or ### An even shorter section. The index.Rmd file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book. 1.2 Render book You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything: Find the Build pane in the RStudio IDE, and Click on Build Book, then select your output format, or select “All formats” if you’d like to use multiple formats from the same book source files. Or build the book from the R console: bookdown::render_book() To render this example to PDF as a bookdown::pdf_book, you’ll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.org/tinytex/. 1.3 Preview book As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in “Preview book”, or from the R console: bookdown::serve_book() "],["introduction-to-r.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction to R 2.1 LEARNING OUTCOMES/OBJECTIVES", " Chapter 2 Introduction to R This is an introductory module in which we will learn the basics of R/Rstudio from installation to loading your first data file into R. R is a high level language that was developed by statisticians and was meant for statisticians. The two statisticians who came up with the language are Rose Ihaka and Robert Gentleman from the University of Aukland Australia. Since its implementation it has gained popularity over time by find use cases in new emerging fields like Data Science and lately in the Pharmaceutical industry now sharing almost an equal place with SAS (Statistical Analysis System) which has been the standard programming language in the Pharma industry for a very long time. What makes R powerful is the idea of packages which is simply a collection of functions and data that have been packaged in a way that makes it easy for use and share with the large community. You will learn how to install and load packages in this module. For those who will advance in the series, you might as well learn how to create them as well. 2.1 LEARNING OUTCOMES/OBJECTIVES i) Installation for both R and Rstudio Install R software @ https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/ Install Rstudio @ https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/ ii) Introduction to Rstudio Interface Familiarize with the Rstudio user interface which we will use heavily. There are other editors that you can use like VS code, but Rstudio is widely used in the industry. iii) Data types We need to understand basic data types before delving into complicated data structures. This will serve as a foundation to our future analysis of data in various contexts. iv) R packages A brief introduction to what packages are, how to install and load them into the system. (we will not cover how to make your own package at this stage yet) V) Data Import from various sources How do you get your data into the R system. There are various ways of achieving this. We shall sample few methods. N/B: Please install both R and Rstudio before our class.
